# Examples of my software
Here's my GitHub profile https://www.github.com/tuh8888. A few items of interest might be:

-This branch of this repo is a re-write of a Java Swing app (also mine) using Cljs with Re-Frame. https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/Knowtator-2.0/tree/cljs

- I'm particularly proud of this recently published repo as it has an implementation of Fibonacci Heap which is notoriously difficult to implement using immutable data structures https://github.com/tuh8888/datascript-shortest-path

- This repo isn't clojure but demonstrates my communications skills. It is referenced frequently to people learning to use virtual GPUs to create virtual machines. https://github.com/tuh8888/libvirt_win10_vm

- This repo demonstrates a lot of good software practices (TDD, notebooks, logging, comments) and also idiomatic clojure (multimethods, lots of FP, clj/cljs/cljc, loop/recur vs reduce, datascript, comment blocks) https://github.com/tuh8888/SME-clj/blob/master/src/sme_clj/core.cljc

- A pull request to the clojure ecosystem I submitted https://github.com/day8/re-frame-undo/pull/4
